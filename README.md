Project Description
ClapX is a Flask-based media control app that listens to microphone input and detects claps. A single clap toggles play/pause, a double clap toggles mute/unmute‚Äîno keyboard needed , a triple clap toggles to next and doing the clap four times toggles it to previous 

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Pressing a button to pause a video? Too mainstream. People need hands-free controls‚Äîeven if it means clapping at your laptop like a confused penguin.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created a clap-detection system that maps claps to keyboard media functions using Python, sound processing, and pyautogui. It's wonderfully weird and it works.
